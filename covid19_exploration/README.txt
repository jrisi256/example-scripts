These files re-create the December 11th working paper version of "The geographic spread of COVID-19 correlates with the structure of social networks as measured by Facebook"

The "_code" folder contains the code to generate all results. One can do so by running "1_run_all_R_scripts.R" in R then "2_run_all_stata_scripts.do" in Stata.

The "_output" folder stores all results.

IMPORTANT: Because of privacy restrictions added to the public release of the SCI data and a different data generation date, the results in this folder differ in small ways from those in the actual paper.
